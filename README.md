- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alessandro
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in space-related engineering. I am a Politecnico di Milano graduate (Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aerospace Engineering) currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Space Engineering. Always looking to learn something new, my interests converge in Orbital Mechanics, Spacecraftâ€™s Guidance-Navigation-Control and Orbital Trajectory Optimization.
